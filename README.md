### Abstract
The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.

### Notes on the code
To run, you need to create a folder called "secrets" in the directory "code" and add to that folder:
1.  A file called service_google_api_key.json that has the json object from your Google service API key (see https://gargle.r-lib.org/articles/non-interactive-auth.html for more information).
2. A file called google_sheet_name.txt that has the id for the google sheet on the first line of an otherwise plain text file.  In this case, you'll almost certainly want to use: 1itaohdPiAeniCXNlntNztZ_oRvjh0HsGuJXUJWET008

### Data
1. Mobility data were made public by Baidu and manually transcribed from their [web site](qiangxi.baidu.com) on February 10th, 2020 and are stored [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ov7Z2IjEPRB41rmRe4oTF1nI6L3EB9_Bn64AJIkOX6g/edit#gid=0). For more information please see: [Baidu service](https://qianxi.baidu.com/), this gnews [post](https://gnews.org/91700/), and this [blog post](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/104119625, it is in Chinese though...) where the author brute-force copied and pasted all the migration indices and proportion into her own spreadsheet, and she did some regression analysis.

3. Our team works collaboratively to maintain a public line list of COVID-19 cases.  You can find [Hubei cases here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1itaohdPiAeniCXNlntNztZ_oRvjh0HsGuJXUJWET008/edit#gid=429276722) and [cases Outside Hubei here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1itaohdPiAeniCXNlntNztZ_oRvjh0HsGuJXUJWET008/edit#gid=0).

Epidemiological data from the 2019 nCoV outbreak: early descriptions

We have collected publicly available information on cases confirmed during the ongoing nCoV-2019 outbreak. Data were entered in a spreadsheet with each line representing a unique case, including age, sex, geographic information, history and time of travel where available. Sources were included as a reference for each entry. Data is openly available here: https://tinyurl.com/s6gsq5y 107 and was last updated at 5pm, GMT, January 23, 2020. We encourage the use of these data, which is intended as a resource for the community.
